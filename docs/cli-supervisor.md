# Shell CLI Supervisor

This guide owns the computer-level `openalice` command surface above Guardian:
background and foreground lifecycle, status presentation, browser opening,
machine-readable envelopes, shell completion, compatibility aliases, and the
boundary of the planned Supervisor TUI.

Installer transactions belong to [[docs/cli-installer.md]]. Source preparation
and the future headless bundle provider belong to [[docs/local-runtime.md]].
Remote orchestration belongs to [[docs/remote-access.md]]. Guardian lock,
takeover, and process-tree truth belong to [[docs/project-structure.md]] and
`packages/guardian-runtime/`.

The active multi-increment TUI and headless-release work is tracked in
[[plans/shell-first-cli-supervisor.md]]. This guide describes only behavior
already shipped in the current tree.

## Product Boundary

The Shell Supervisor controls the local OpenAlice Runtime. It does not reproduce
the OpenAlice Web product:

```text
openalice lifecycle command
  -> presentation-neutral lifecycle core
      -> Guardian control endpoint and lease
          -> Alice + optional UTA + optional Connector

browser / Electron
  -> product interaction
```

Lifecycle commands do not edit Workspaces, credentials, broker state, trading
permissions, or product configuration. Browser closure and shell exit do not
stop a detached Runtime.

## Canonical Lifecycle Commands

The top-level lifecycle surface is:

```bash
openalice up [path] [options]
openalice run [path] [options]
openalice down [options]
openalice status [options]
openalice open [options]
```

| Command | Contract |
|---|---|
| `up` | Prepare the source provider when needed, start `cli-server` detached, and return only after Guardian control plus Alice HTTP readiness |
| `run` | Start the same `cli-server` owner in the foreground without opening a browser; normal Ctrl+C/SIGTERM stops that self-owned tree |
| `down` | Ask a matching Guardian to stop itself, then wait for endpoint and ownership release |
| `status` | Read normalized status without mutation |
| `open` | Require an advertised Web endpoint and a successful `/api/auth/status` probe before invoking the platform browser opener |

`up` is idempotent for an already healthy matching owner. `down` is idempotent
when no owner exists. Ordinary start never signals another owner. `--takeover`
delegates replacement to Guardian's established discover, TERM, grace, KILL,
wait, then acquire ordering.

The current Runtime provider remains source-backed. `up` and `run` therefore
accept the checkout, preparation, rebuild, home, port, wait, and takeover
options documented in [[docs/local-runtime.md]]. `up` is browserless by default;
`--open` performs a separate verified browser open after readiness.

## Default and Compatibility Surface

During the migration toward the Supervisor TUI:

- bare `openalice` and `openalice start` retain the existing foreground,
  browser-oriented source launcher;
- `openalice server run|start|status|stop` remains available for managed remote
  and existing scripts;
- new code uses `run|up|status|down`;
- `server status --json` retains its legacy raw status payload;
- the future change that makes bare `openalice` enter the TUI requires its own
  PTY acceptance and compatibility decision.

The top-level commands and the `server` compatibility surface launch the same
`cli-server` Guardian owner. They are presenters over one lifecycle rather than
separate daemons.

## Presentation-neutral Core

`packages/cli/src/lifecycle.mjs` owns:

- complete-home resolution;
- idempotent matching-owner discovery;
- source-provider preparation;
- detached or foreground Guardian spawn;
- readiness and early-exit handling;
- structured start results and lifecycle events;
- graceful stop delegation;
- verified Web opening.

It returns structured values and does not decide human or JSON wording.
`packages/cli/src/lifecycle-command.mjs` owns top-level parsing, presentation,
help, completion, and JSON envelopes. `packages/cli/src/server.mjs` is the
legacy presenter.

Source preparation may emit bounded progress through an output sink supplied by
the presenter. Lifecycle truth still comes only from Guardian control and
readiness probes; human progress or log text is never parsed as state.

## Machine-readable Contract

Top-level `up`, `down`, and `status` accept `--json`. Successful output uses:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "command": "status",
  "ok": true,
  "result": {
    "status": {}
  }
}
```

Runtime failures after parsing use the same envelope on stderr:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "command": "down",
  "ok": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "EOWNED",
    "message": "..."
  }
}
```

The nested normalized status retains Guardian protocol, lifecycle class,
Runtime version when known, selected home, sanitized owner, loopback Web
endpoint, component state, capabilities, and safe diagnostic detail. It never
includes lock tokens, credentials, internal ports, or arbitrary environment
values.

Exit behavior is:

- `0`: the requested action completed, including already-running `up`,
  already-absent `down`, or a successfully inspected non-running status;
- `1`: Runtime, control, readiness, browser, or other operational failure;
- `2`: invalid lifecycle syntax, option, shell name, or root command.

Scripts determine running versus absent from the status class, not from a
special nonzero `status` exit.

## Human Status

Human `status` reports:

- lifecycle class and selected complete home;
- running Runtime product version when available;
- owner surface and PID;
- verified advertised Web URL;
- Alice, UTA, and Connector state;
- source launch root and safe diagnostic detail when available.

An Electron-owned or dev-owned Runtime may be inspected and opened, but
`down` refuses it. Only a matching `cli-server` that advertises
`runtime.stop` accepts the stop transaction.

## Shell Completion

Completion is generated from the root command registry:

```bash
openalice completion bash
openalice completion zsh
openalice completion fish
openalice completion powershell
```

The command prints to stdout and never edits shell configuration. The root
commands and lifecycle option names share the same registry used by generated
completion; detailed shell installation remains user-owned.

## Load-bearing Files

- `packages/cli/bin/openalice.mjs` — root dispatch and process exit mapping.
- `packages/cli/src/lifecycle.mjs` — presentation-neutral lifecycle.
- `packages/cli/src/lifecycle-command.mjs` — canonical command parsing and
  presentation.
- `packages/cli/src/server.mjs` — legacy `server` presenter.
- `packages/cli/src/server-control.mjs` — local control client and normalized
  status.
- `scripts/guardian/control-server.mjs` — Guardian control server.
- `scripts/guardian/prod.mjs` — built Runtime owner/status source.
- `packages/cli/src/lifecycle{,-command}.spec.mjs` — lifecycle and presentation
  contracts.
- `packages/cli/src/server{,-control}.spec.mjs` — compatibility and control
  contracts.

## Verification

For command-only changes:

```bash
pnpm -F @traderalice/openalice-cli test
npx tsc --noEmit
pnpm test
```

For launcher ownership or takeover changes:

```bash
pnpm test:guardian-recovery
```

For a distributed payload change:

```bash
pnpm test:install:docker
```

Manually use an isolated home and unused port to walk:

```bash
openalice up --home <temporary-home> --port <unused-port>
openalice status --home <temporary-home>
openalice status --home <temporary-home> --json
openalice open --home <temporary-home>
openalice down --home <temporary-home>
```

Verify the real `/api/auth/status` and root page after `up`, prove the Runtime
survives the starting shell, and prove `down` leaves no Guardian/Alice child.
When shared Runtime or dependency topology changes, add the matching Electron
PTY/package smoke even though this CLI does not own Electron.
